What is a PID?
PID stands for Process Identifier. It is a unique numerical identifier assigned to a running process in an operating system. PIDs are used by the operating system to track and manage processes. Each process running on a system has its own unique PID.

What is a process?
In computing, a process is an instance of a program that is being executed. It is an executing instance of a program that has a unique process ID, its own set of resources, and is managed by the operating system. Processes are the fundamental units of work in a computer system.

How to find a process' PID?
There are several ways to find the PID of a process:

Using the ps command: The ps command displays information about active processes. To find the PID of a process, you can use the command ps aux | grep <process_name>. This will list the processes matching the given name along with their PIDs.

Using the pgrep command: The pgrep command allows you to find the PID of a process based on its name. Simply use the command pgrep <process_name> to retrieve the PID.

Using the pidof command: The pidof command is another way to find the PID of a process. It takes a program name as an argument and returns the PID(s) of the matching process(es). For example, pidof <process_name>.

How to kill a process?
To terminate a process, you can use the kill command followed by the PID of the process you want to kill. The basic syntax is kill <PID>. By default, the kill command sends a SIGTERM signal to the process, which allows it to perform cleanup tasks and terminate gracefully. If the process does not respond to SIGTERM, you can send a stronger signal using kill -9 <PID> to forcefully terminate the process.

What is a signal?
In Linux, a signal is a software interrupt delivered to a process. Signals are used to communicate with processes and manage their behavior. Signals can be generated by the system, by other processes, or even by the process itself. They can be used for various purposes such as process termination, error handling, or inter-process communication.

What are the two signals that cannot be ignored?
The two signals that cannot be ignored by a process are:

SIGKILL (signal number 9): This signal is used to forcefully terminate a process. It cannot be caught or ignored by the process. When a process receives a SIGKILL signal, it is immediately terminated without any chance to perform cleanup tasks.

SIGSTOP (signal number 19 or 17): This signal is used to pause (stop) a process. Similar to SIGKILL, SIGSTOP cannot be caught or ignored by the process. When a process receives a SIGSTOP signal, it is suspended and put in a stopped state. The process can be resumed later using the SIGCONT signal.
